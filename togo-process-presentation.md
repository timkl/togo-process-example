# ToGo Process

---

## Agenda

* Trello board
* Process steps
* Committing to the ToGo repo
* Icons
* Next steps

---

## Trello board

* Do we need additional buckets?
* Labels:
	1. New pattern.
	2. Updated pattern.
	3. Removing pattern.

---

## Process step 1/1

* Add design to Trello. Could be mockups, Codepen etc.

---

## Process step 2/3

* Get approval. Meg has final say as the owner of ToGo.

---

## Process step 3/3

* Implementation + QA. Designers can either:
	1. Let Nathan or John update the ToGo stylesheets.
	2. Update the stylesheets themselves in a separate branch and send a pull request to Nathan & John.
	3. Nathan & John are responsible for QA, but designers can help out by ensuring browser compatibility, accessibility etc.

## Icon font

* How can we make it easy for each individual designer to commit icons to the font?
* Multiple Icomoon accounts?

---

## Next steps

* Tim will create a PR on a subtle style change, e.g. a 1px border-radius on all buttons.
* Anything else?
